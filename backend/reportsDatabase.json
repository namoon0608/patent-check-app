The header's adjustment mechanism and the auger's rotation could potentially function like the angled plates and toothed edge of the patented tool. However, the primary function of the header and auger is not specifically designed for gravel and stone movement, which makes the infringement likelihood moderate.","specific_features":["Header adjustment mechanism potentially similar to angled plates","Unloading auger potentially similar to toothed edge"]},{"product_name":"ActiveYield","infringement_likelihood":"Low","relevant_claims":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],"explanation":"ActiveYield focuses on yield calibration, not on moving materials. While the system might have some elements that could relate to the rake and spreader concept, its primary function is to measure and adjust yield, not to directly manipulate materials.

While the S700 Combine Harvester's header and auger potentially have functionalities that could be considered similar to the patented tool, the primary purpose of these features is not for moving gravel and stone.
